**Git Basics**

**Introduction to Git**

**Git is a distributed version control system (VCS)** used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is designed to be fast, efficient, and reliable. It supports non-linear development workflows, making it ideal for both small and large projects.

**Key Features:**
> Distributed: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository.

> Fast Performance: Operations like commit, merge, and branch are optimized for speed.

> Branching and Merging: Lightweight branches and powerful merge capabilities support parallel development.

> Data Integrity: Each change is checksummed to ensure code integrity.

> Collaboration: Easily integrates with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for team collaboration.
